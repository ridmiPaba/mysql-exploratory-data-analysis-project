Product Report
===============================================================================================
Purpose:
    - This report consolidates key product metrics and behaviors.

Highlights:
1. Gathers essential fields such as product name, category, subcategory, and cost.
2. Segments products by revenue to identify High-Performers, Mid-Range, or Low-Performers.
3. Aggregates product-level metrics:
    - total orders
    - total sales
    - total quantity sold
    - total customers (unique)
    - lifespan (in months)
4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
    - recency (months since last sale)
    - average order revenue (AOR)
    - average monthly revenue
